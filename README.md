# MSG-StyleGAN

Reference model link : https://github.com/akanimax/msg-stylegan-tf 

The code is take from the reference of stylegan model from github.

The idea is to generate fake images using code files and prepare as a dataset for further implementation.

Here I have used predefined weight of stylegan , you can do both the things either you can use directly or do transfer learning and train it for further use.

Just unzip the folder and follow the code file as .ipynb file for better understanding of code.

You can find the final images using seeds or in the location that you will mentioned.
